# Energy Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing energy data using various machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to preprocess the data, apply different regression models, evaluate their performance, and visualize the results. The models used include Linear Regression, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Decision Trees. Addtionally, clustering is used to create two regions for potential investment for investors.The data is from 200-2019 and is contains information about countries world wide.

## Developer Requirements
- Python 3.12 or greater
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- shap
- scikit-learn
- plotly
- numpy

## Developer Setup
To set up the development environment, you need Python and the required libraries. Python is used for running scripts and machine learning models, while libraries like scikit-learn are essential for implementing various algorithms.

# Visualization and Reporting
Data visualization is performed using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to create comprehensive reports and dashboards.

# Contributions and Testing
Developers can contribute by cloning the repository, making changes, and submitting pull requests.This repository is still under development.
Testing is performed using the cross-validation methods from scikit-learn.

#Data avalabilty
The data is from hugging face.
